# Monologue 

For me, I want to learn these things
- databases and SQL
- proper programming/software practices
- learn X and Y language (Go, Crystal)

then i break this down to smaller parts based on priority

## Proper programming/software practices

- Read Code Craft 30 minutes a day.

After I am done with that

## Learn Go

- Watch Learn Go in 3 Hours
- Read Writing Interpreters in Go

## Learn Crystal

- Read the Crystal Programming Book

### Side quest

- Learn how to read a specification
  - Learn RDF
- Write a crystal *shard* (lib) for RDF
- Write a go lib for RDF
- Write a rust lib for RDF
- Learn bioinformatics and its importance by reading articles that use [rust-bio](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio).
