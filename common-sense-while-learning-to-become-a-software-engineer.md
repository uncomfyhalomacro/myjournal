# So there are many stuff in software that requires "common sense"

- personal projects; you are free to do your own style and rules
- collaboration projects; you are required to create "house styles" and you and your team, whether you dislike it or not, should follow.
- a good programmer should focus their energy on learning and what makes them productive
  - they avoid pointless philosophical arguments
  - one exception if the argument is based on facts and not based on feelings
- avoid quick-rich schemes. filipinos fall for this and loves to embrace corruption
- a bad programmer is the one who assumes they know everything
  - like any field or subject, you can't know everything but enough to become a master or an expert
- your fetish on tools should not be forced to someone unless they asked for it
- programming and software is not everything. a monotonous life is a boring one.
- learn beyond your understanding. be afraid and embrace it. there are no shortcuts
