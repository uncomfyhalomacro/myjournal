Todos on how to write Wayland bindings for Crystal language:

1. Familiarize yourself with Wayland: Before you start writing bindings, you need to have a good understanding of the Wayland protocol and how it works. 
   The official Wayland website provides a lot of documentation and resources to help you get started.
2. Study existing bindings: There are already a few Wayland bindings available for other programming languages, such as C and Rust. 
   Studying these bindings can give you a good idea of how to structure your own bindings and what kind of features you should aim to provide.
3. Decide on the binding approach: There are a few different approaches you can take when writing bindings for Wayland. One approach is to use the 
   Wayland scanner tool to generate bindings automatically based on the Wayland protocol XML files. Another approach is to write the bindings 
   manually, which gives you more control over the API and can make it easier to provide a more Crystal-like interface.

4. Start writing bindings: Once you've decided on your approach, you can start writing the bindings. You'll need to define the types, functions, 
   and constants for the Wayland protocol in Crystal syntax, and provide a high-level API that makes it easy for Crystal developers to use Wayland.
5. Test and refine: After you've written the initial bindings, you'll need to test them thoroughly to make sure they work as expected. 
  You may also need to refine the API based on feedback from other developers or your own experience using the bindings.
6. Publish and maintain: Once you're satisfied with your bindings, you can publish them on a package repository such as GitHub or the Crystal 
   Shards website
