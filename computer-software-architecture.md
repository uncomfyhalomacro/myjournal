## Evolution of automated computing devices


### Analytical engine

- The Analytcal Engine was designed by Charles Babbage's original creation.
  - It consists of 40 decimal digits and does not support floating-point
    mathematics.

### ENIAC

- The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first programmable
  general-purpose electronic computer.
  - Weighs 27 tons and consumes 150 kilowatts of power.
  - Lots of vacuum tubes, diodes and relays.

- In 1948, ENIAC was improved the ability to program via punch cards.
  - John von Neumann proposed a processing component with an arithmetic logic
    and registers, and a control unit that contained an instruction register
    and a program counter. This became known as the **von Neumann architecture**.

### IBM PC
