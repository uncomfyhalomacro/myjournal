# Idea or Problem

What is the current state of higher education in PH? The context could
be in the scope of your subject you teach (e.g. biology AND chemistry
subjects). Having domain knowledge and experience helps, because we can add
to the narrative power---for example, we could articulate it like *the author
teaches biology and chemistry subjects at MU institution*.

The following colleges are required to have biochemistry as their major
subject for their respective students during their first year:

- Maritime (Marine Transportation)
- Nursing
- Medical Technology

The Department of Natural Sciences handles Biochemistry and provides guidelines
and teaching manuals for strategies on how to communicate and deliver to educate.

However, there are varying degrees of retention (is that the term?) when teaching 
these students as some have varying backgrounds, non-STEM vs STEM.

<!--TODO: brief thing we are looking for uwu-->


# Notes 

As an educator you may have noticed how ineffective some strategies may be,
or that students are not receiving/perceiving the strategies set out by the
institution. Or we can take a step back and look at it from what *group*
of students we may be interested in comparing.

# Possible research questions

1. What is aimed to be taught?
2. What content is being delivered in class/labs?
3. What content are the students actually (not) picking up?
